# Dannys-Diner-
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Project Overview
Danny's Diner aims to create a deeper connection with customers by analyzing their behaviors and preferences. This project is designed to help Danny analyze customer data, enhance customer relationships, and optimize the diner’s loyalty program. It leverages SQL databases to provide insights into customer spending patterns, visiting habits, and menu preferences.

```sql
--Create table "sales"
CREATE TABLE sales (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "order_date" DATE,
  "product_id" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO sales
  ("customer_id", "order_date", "product_id")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-02', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-04', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-11', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-16', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-02-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-07', '3');
```

```sql
--Create Table "menu"
CREATE TABLE menu (
  "product_id" INTEGER,
  "product_name" VARCHAR(5),
  "price" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO menu
  ("product_id", "product_name", "price")
VALUES
  ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');
```

```sql  
--Create Table "members"
CREATE TABLE members (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "join_date" DATE
);

INSERT INTO members
  ("customer_id", "join_date")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');
```

```sql
--Adding Primary Key in menu table
ALTER TABLE menu
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_sales
PRIMARY KEY(product_id);

--Adding foreign key in sales table

ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_menu
FOREIGN KEY(product_id)
REFERENCES menu(product_id);
```

## Conclusion
By leveraging the insights gained from the data, Danny can deliver a more personalized experience. These queries will provide Danny with valuable insights into customer behavior, spending, and preferences, helping him evaluate the effectiveness of his loyalty program and consider potential expansions.
